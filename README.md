## Specialized Topics
6. **Athey, S., & Imbens, G. W. (2017)**: "The State of Applied Econometrics: Causality and Policy Evaluation". A paper that discusses modern approaches in applied econometrics, specifically causality and policy evaluation.
7. **Chernozhukov, V., Hansen, C., & Spindler, M. (2015)**: "Valid Post-Selection and Post-Regularization Inference: An Elementary, General Approach". For readers interested in post-selection inference, crucial for understanding model selection in causal analysis.

## Practical Application
8. **Belloni, A., Chernozhukov, V., & Hansen, C. (2014)**: "Inference on Treatment Effects after Selection among High-Dimensional Controls". This paper provides practical guidance on dealing with high-dimensional controls in causal inference.
9. **Xu, Y. (2017)**: "Generalized Synthetic Control Method: Causal Inference with Interactive Fixed Effects Models". A practical guide to the generalized synthetic control method, useful for applied researchers.

## Cutting-Edge Research
