  abstract  = "Now in its fourth edition, this comprehensive introduction of
               fundamental panel data methodologies provides insights on what
               is most essential in panel literature. A capstone to the
               forty-year career of a pioneer of panel data analysis, this new
               edition's primary contribution will be the coverage of
               advancements in panel data analysis, a statistical method widely
               used to analyze two or higher-dimensional panel data. The topics
               discussed in early editions have been reorganized and
               streamlined to comprehensively introduce panel econometric
               methodologies useful for identifying causal relationships among
               variables, supported by interdisciplinary examples and case
               studies. This book, to be featured in Cambridge's Econometric
               Society Monographs series, has been the leader in the field
               since the first edition. It is essential reading for
               researchers, practitioners and graduate students interested in
               the analysis of microeconomic behavior.",

               J{\"o}rn-Steffen Pischke, an irreverent guide to the essentials
               of econometricsThe core methods in today's econometric toolkit
               are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental
               variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and
               differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes.
               In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address
               clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase
               learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does
               education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how
               the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to
               speak.In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless
               Econometrics covers important new
               extensions---regression-discontinuity designs and quantile
               regression---as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua
               Angrist and J{\"o}rn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier
               econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even
               dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this
               book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary

               level text on microeconometric methods, substantially revised
               and updated.The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text
               provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary
               econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By
               focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content,
               the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while
               emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear
               and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or
               individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation
               frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum
               likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered
               in detail, including probit and logit models and their
               multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and
               missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and
               duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and
               Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on
               microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be
               separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second
               edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements
               include a broader class of models for missing data problems;
               more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic
               for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of ``generalized
               instrumental variables'' (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based
               on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability
               weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment
               effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between
               econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the
               ``generalized estimating equation'' literature popular in
               statistics and other fields. New attention is given to
               explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied;
               the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why
               certain ``obvious'' procedures do not. The numerous included
               exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader
               to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.",
